# Engagement-Data-Analysis
Task
For this assessment, we’d like to see how you approach discovery, problem solving, and
communication for an analytics project.
1. What is the typical engagement rate we can expect? What’s the likelihood that we can
achieve a 15% engagement rate?
2. Does day of the week and time of posting affect engagement rates?
3. How are our game titles doing in terms of social performance? Is there a specific game
we should focus more on or less?
4. What media type performs the best?
5. What is our best performing campaign?
6. Define out a posting strategy for our social channels based on your discoveries.
7. What suggestions would you give to the social media team if they want to expand their
presence (e.g. if our CSGO youtube channel is doing well should we expand to TikTok)?
